1. This experiment introduces the concept of the hierarchical transformations and a hierarchical model.

2. The hierarchical articulated arm is provided. Notice the different nodes used to construct the model. The nodes in this model follows the hierarchy: Shoulder (highest), Elbow, Forearm, Wrist and Palm. Applying transformations to a node in the hierarchy applies the same transformations to all the lower nodes in the hierarchy in addition to their own transformations. For example, a rotation has been applied to the shoulder. As you drag the slider you can notice this rotation being applied to the other nodes toother nodes.

3. Try modifying the transformations in the hierarchy and notice the effective changes on the entire model.

4. Open the transormation nodes of Forearm and Palm and notice how a Cube has been moulded to a forearm and a palm using the respective transformations.
